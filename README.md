### Why Are Some Things Transparent?

1. Electrons do not have size. (point particle -- not size)
2. They can only occupy certain energy levels. (different types of atoms have different energy levels and also depends on how atoms are bonded (?))
3. If energy is definete, then position is not.
4. Until we try to detect positon of electron with photon it is in a superposition of all the places. => since it is "everythere" photon will hit electron
5. Electrons are greedy (?) so it will be absorb (?) the photon.
6. Electrons can only jump up energy levels when you give them just the right type of light (wave lenght)
7. Jumping up energy levels is not the only way electrons can absorb of light.
8. Electrons very picky how the absorb the light.
9. Resonant absorption. "Right" photon -> electron gets excited -> electron jumps to a higher energy level
10. Gas molecule (80% of air). "Right" photon -> electron gets excited -> calm down by releasing new photon
11. Water (liquid) or Glass (solid) molecule [other molecules are too close] -> calm down by giving up that energy to MOVE the other molecules -> increases the thermal energy (temperature) instead of releasing photon
12. "Wrong" photon immediately rejected
13. In real life there are a lot of photons and electrons. Photons goes everythere inside the glass. Those photons interfere (?) and cancel (?) each other in most places. Where they don't cancel you get the light we actually see. Refractive index (atom organizetion).
14. Atoms have different energy levels (see 2)
15. When atoms bond to each other to form solids the energy levels moves closer together to form bands this leaves large energy gaps between. Gap between bands in glass is about 9 electron volts (?) which is to big for visible light. To excite electron photon has to have an energy at least 9 electron volts (?) (wavelength at most 138 nm == ultraviolet) --> visible light rejected --> Transparency
